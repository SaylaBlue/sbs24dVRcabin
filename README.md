Summary
I made a simple cabin with a bed, places for storage, rug, a fan, and some books for entertainment. I felt like the cabins bedroom had everything i would want to add but it didnt feel like a cabin, so i creaated a terrain. The cabin is surrounded by hills with birch and oak trees and some grass. For this project I used gemini to get a code that makes interacting with a light switch activate the fan. I also learned how to create grass and paint a terrain.
